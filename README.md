# Libft
The purpose of this project is to re-code some libc functions, as well as other common utility functions to be reused in the subsequent 42 projects.

It also includes two other projects from the 42 Curriculum since they are often used in the same projects:

**get_next_line()**, returns the next line from a file descriptor. Which is similar to fgets() from stdio.h

**ft_printf()**, a printf() clone.
